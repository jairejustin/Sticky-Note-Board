# Sticky Note Board

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=react,css,html,javascript\&theme=dark)](https://skillicons.dev)

A simple **sticky notes web application** where you can create, edit, delete, and drag notes across the board. This project is based on [Dennis Ivyâ€™s tutorial](https://sticky-fcc.vercel.app/) with one change, it uses **browser localStorage** instead of AppWrite for saving notes. 

## Deployment
The application is live on Vercel: 
https://sticky-notes-chi.vercel.app/

## Features

* Create, edit, and delete notes.
* Drag and drop notes to reposition them on the board.
* Auto-save notes locally using LocalStorage.
* Fully responsive and works on both desktop and mobile.
