# Sticky Note Board

[![TECH](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=react,vite,css,html,javascript\&theme=dark)](https://skillicons.dev)

A simple **sticky notes web application** where you can create, edit, delete, and drag notes across the board. This project is based on [Dennis Ivy’s tutorial](https://sticky-fcc.vercel.app/) with one change, it uses **browser localStorage** instead of AppWrite for saving notes. 

## Features

* Create, edit, and delete notes.
* Drag and drop notes to reposition them on the board.
* Auto-save notes locally using LocalStorage.
* Is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile (some bugs on mobile though).

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jairejustin/Sticky-Note-Board.git
cd Sticky-Note-Board
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal) in your browser to see the app.
