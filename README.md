# Sticky Note Board
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)

A simple notes web application, but with sticky notes. Notes can be dragged across the board to change position. This project was originally inspired by [this tutorial](https://sticky-fcc.vercel.app/) with plans of incorporating my own features.

## Clone:
```bash
